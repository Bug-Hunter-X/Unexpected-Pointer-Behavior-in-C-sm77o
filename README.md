This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in C programming involving pointer manipulation. The code showcases a scenario where a pointer's value is unexpectedly retained even after it points to a different variable.  Understanding the behavior of pointers is critical to avoid similar bugs. The solution demonstrates a proper way to handle pointers to avoid this unexpected behavior.
